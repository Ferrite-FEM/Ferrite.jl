    "where $M$ is a possibly time-dependent and not necessarily invertible mass matrix,\n",
    "$u$ the vector of unknowns and $f$ the right-hand-side (RHS). For us $f$ can be interpreted as\n",
    "the spatial discretization of all linear and nonlinear operators depending on $u$ and $t$,\n",
    "but not on the time derivative of $u$.\n",

    "## Some Theory on the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations\n",

    "### Problem Description in Strong Form\n",
