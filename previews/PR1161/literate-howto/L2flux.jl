# L2Projection for fluxes
As a prototype problem, we consider simplified version of the
[heat equation tutorial](@ref tutorial-heat-equation) with out any heat source.
Our problem can be stated as
```math
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{div}(\boldsymbol{q}) &= 0\quad \text{in } \Omega \\
\boldsymbol{q}\cdot\boldsymbol{n} &= 0 \quad \text{on } \Gamma_N \\
T &= -1 \quad \text{on } \Gamma_0\\
T &= 1 \quad \text{on } \Gamma_1
\end{align*}
```
where $\boldsymbol{q} = -k(\boldsymbol{x}) \nabla T$ is the heat flux that
we will visualize. The heat conductivity,
```math
k(\boldsymbol{x}) = \left\lbrace
\begin{matrix}
1.0, \boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_h \\
0.1, \boldsymbol{x}\in\Omega_l
\end{matrix}\right.
```

We create the described geometry and grid using the following code,
=#
using Ferrite

grid = generate_grid(Triangle, (10, 10))
addcellset!(grid, "low_k", x -> x[2] < -1.0e-3 || x[1] > 1.0e-3)
#=

Next, we solve the described FE problem, following the [heat equation tutorial](@ref tutorial-heat-equation),
with the extra complication of a varying heat conductivity and non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
conditions,
=#

ipu = Lagrange{RefTriangle, 2}()
dh = close!(add!(DofHandler(grid), :T, ipu))
qr = QuadratureRule{RefTriangle}(2)
cv = CellValues(qr, ipu, Lagrange{RefTriangle, 1}())

function solve_fe(dh, cv, low_k_set)
    K = allocate_matrix(dh)
    f = zeros(ndofs(dh))

    Ke = zeros(getnbasefunctions(cv), getnbasefunctions(cv))
    assembler = start_assemble(K)
    for cell in CellIterator(dh)
        reinit!(cv, cell)
        fill!(Ke, 0)
        k = cellid(cell) in low_k_set ? 0.1 : 1.0
        for q_point in 1:getnquadpoints(cv)
            dΩ = getdetJdV(cv, q_point)
            for i in 1:getnbasefunctions(cv)
                ∇Ni = shape_gradient(cv, q_point, i)
                for j in 1:getnbasefunctions(cv)
                    ∇Nj = shape_gradient(cv, q_point, j)
                    Ke[i, j] += k * (∇Ni ⋅ ∇Nj) * dΩ
                end
            end
        end
        assemble!(assembler, celldofs(cell), Ke)
    end

    ch = ConstraintHandler(dh)
    add!(ch, Dirichlet(:T, getfacetset(dh.grid, "left"), Returns(-1.0)))
    add!(ch, Dirichlet(:T, getfacetset(dh.grid, "right"), Returns(+1.0)))
    close!(ch)
    apply!(K, f, ch)
    return K \ f
end

a = solve_fe(dh, cv, getcellset(grid, "low_k"));

This gives the continuous temperature field,

![Temperature field](L2flux_temperature.png)

**Figure 2:** Continuous temperature solution

Even though the temperature is continuous, the flux, $\boldsymbol{q}$, becomes discontinuous
due to the jump of heat conductivity between $\Omega_h$ and $\Omega_l$. It will therefore not
be correct to project he heat flux onto a continuous field. On the other hand, the conservation
law requires that the divergence of the heat flux doesn't go to infinity. This translates to a
heat flux that is continuous in the normal direction. Ferrite can describe so-called $H(\mathrm{div})$
function spaces, and here we will use `RaviartThomas` interpolations to do so.

Specifically, the difference between projecting onto `DiscontinuousLagrange` ($L^2$),
`Lagrange` ($H^1$) and `RaviartThomas` $H(\mathrm{div})$ interpolations will be demonstrated.

To project the fluxes, we first calculate the fluxes in the quadrature points,
=#

function calculate_qp_flux(cv, a, cell, low_k_set)
    k = cellid(cell) in low_k_set ? 0.1 : 1.0
    reinit!(cv, cell)
    ae = a[celldofs(cell)]
    return [-k * function_gradient(cv, q_point, ae) for q_point in 1:getnquadpoints(cv)]
end

qp_data = [calculate_qp_flux(cv, a, cell, getcellset(grid, "low_k")) for cell in CellIterator(dh)];

#=
Next, we project the solution and export it for interpolation. Note that 2nd order `RaviartThomas` has
8 base functions per triangle cell compared to 6 for vectorized linear `DiscontinuousLagrange` and `Lagrange`.
=#
function project_and_export(name, dofhandler, sol, grid, qr_rhs, ip, type, data)
    proj = L2Projector{type}(grid)
    add!(proj, 1:getncells(grid), ip; qr_rhs)
    close!(proj)
    return VTKGridFile(name, dofhandler; write_discontinuous = Ferrite.is_discontinuous(ip)) do vtk
        write_solution(vtk, dofhandler, sol)
        Ferrite.write_cellset(vtk, grid, "low_k")
        write_projection(vtk, proj, project(proj, data), "q")
    end
end

project_and_export("proj_L2", dh, a, grid, qr, DiscontinuousLagrange{RefTriangle, 1}(), :scalar, qp_data)
project_and_export("proj_H1", dh, a, grid, qr, Lagrange{RefTriangle, 1}(), :scalar, qp_data)
project_and_export("proj_Hdiv", dh, a, grid, qr, RaviartThomas{RefTriangle, 2}(), :tensor, qp_data)

![Different projections for H1 and H(div)](L2flux.png)
**Figure 3:** $q_1$ flux projected onto different function spaces,
with increasing continuity requirements from left to right,
$L_2$, $H(\mathrm{div})$, and $H^1$.

From these results, we observe that both the discontinuous interpolations,
`DiscontinuousLagrange` and `RaviartThomas`, correctly gives a sharp jump in
the flux from the bottom to the top side. When forcing the discontinuous solution
onto a continuous field for the `Lagrange` interpolation, we get some non-physical
artifacts. Comparing the discontinuous interpolations, we note that neither gives
a perfectly continuous flux within each domain. $H(\mathrm{div})$ interpolations only
guarantee continuous normal fluxes across element boundaries, so this is expected on
the slanted element edges. Finally, we note that there is less sharp non-physical jumps
for the $H(\mathrm{div})$ projection compared to the $L_2$ projection in the x-direction.
