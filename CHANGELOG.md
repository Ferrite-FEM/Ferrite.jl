and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
 - Fix an issue in constraint application of `Symmetric`-wrapped sparse matrices (i.e.
   obtained from `create_symmatric_sparsity_pattern`). In particular, `apply!(K::Symmetric,
   f, ch)` would incorrectly modify `f` if any of the constraints were inhomogeneous.
   ([#592][github-592])

## [0.3.11] - 2023-01-17
### Added
 - [Metis.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSparse/Metis.jl) extension for fill-reducing DoF
   permutation. This uses Julias new package extension mechanism (requires Julia 1.10) to
   support a new DoF renumbering order `DofOrder.Ext{Metis}()` that can be passed to
   `renumber!` to renumber DoFs using the Metis.jl library. ([#393][github-393],
   [#549][github-549])
 - [BlockArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/BlockArrays.jl) extension for creating a
   globally blocked system matrix. `create_sparsity_pattern(BlockMatrix, dh, ch; kwargs...)`
   return a matrix that is blocked by field (requires DoFs to be (re)numbered by field, i.e.
   `renumber!(dh, DofOrder.FieldWise())`). For custom blocking it is possible to pass an
   uninitialized `BlockMatrix` with the correct block sizes (see `BlockArrays.jl` docs).
   This functionality is useful for e.g. special solvers where individual blocks need to be
   extracted. Requires Julia version 1.9 or above. ([#567][github-567])
 - New function `apply_analytical!` for setting the values of the degrees of freedom for a
   specific field according to a spatial function `f(x)`. ([#532][github-532])
 - New cache struct `CellCache` to be used when iterating over the cells in a grid or DoF
   handler. `CellCache` caches nodes, coordinates, and DoFs, for the cell. The cache `cc`
   can be re-initialized for a new cell index `ci` by calling `reinit!(cc, ci)`. This can be
   used as an alternative to `CellIterator` when more control over which element to loop
   over is needed. See documentation for `CellCache` for more information.
   ([#546][github-546])
 - It is now possible to create the sparsity pattern without constrained entries (they will
   be zeroed out later anyway) by passing `keep_constrained=false` to
   `create_sparsity_pattern`. This naturally only works together with local condensation of
   constraints since there won't be space allocated in the global matrix for the full (i.e.
   "non-condensed") element matrix. Creating the matrix without constrained entries reduces
   the memory footprint, but unless a significant amount of DoFs are constrained (e.g. high
   mesh resolution at a boundary) the savings are negligible. ([#539][github-539])
### Changed
 - `ConstraintHandler`: `update!` is now called implicitly in `close!`. This was easy to
   miss, and somewhat of a strange requirement when solving problems without time stepping.
   ([#459][github-459])
 - The function for computing the inhomogeneity in a `Dirichlet` constraint can now be
   specified as either `f(x)` or `f(x, t)`, where `x` is the spatial coordinate and `t` the
   time. ([#459][github-459])
 - The elements of a `CellIterator` are now `CellCache` instead of the iterator itself,
   which was confusing in some cases. This change does not affect typical user code.
   ([#546][github-546])
### Deprecated
 - Adding fields to a DoF handler with `push!(dh, ...)` has been deprecated in favor of
   `add!(dh, ...)`. This is to make it consistent with how constraints are added to a
   constraint handler. ([#578][github-578])
### Fixed
 - Fix `shape_value` for the linear, discontinuous Lagrange interpolation.
   ([#553][github-553])
 - Fix `reference_coordinate` dispatch for discontinuous Lagrange interpolations.
   ([#559][github-559])
 - Fix `show(::Grid)` for custom cell types. ([#570][github-570])
 - Fix `apply_zero!(Î”a, ch)` when using inhomogeneous affine constraints
   ([#575][github-575])
### Other improvements
 - Internal changes defining a new global matrix/vector "interface". These changes make it
   easy to enable more array types (e.g. `BlockMatrix` support added in this release) and
   solvers in the future. ([#562][github-562], [#571][github-571])
 - Performance improvements:
    - Reduced time and memory allocations for global sparse matrix creation (Julia >= 1.10).
      ([#563][github-563])
 - Documentation improvements:
    - Added an overview of the Examples section. ([#531][github-531])
    - Added an example showing topology optimization. ([#531][github-531])
    - Various typo fixes. ([#574][github-574])
    - Fix broken links. ([#583][github-583])

## [0.3.10] - 2022-12-11
### Added
 - New functions `apply_local!` and `apply_assemble!` for applying constraints locally on
   the element level before assembling to the global system. ([#528][github-528])
 - New functionality to renumber DoFs by fields or by components. This is useful when you
   need the global matrix to be blocked. ([#378][github-378], [#545][github-545])
 - Functionality to renumber DoFs in DofHandler and ConstraintHandler simultaneously:
   `renumber!(dh::DofHandler, ch::ConstraintHandler, order)`. Previously renumbering had to
   be done *before* creating the ConstraintHandler since otherwise DoF numbers would be
   inconsistent. However, this was inconvenient in cases where the constraints impact the
   new DoF order permutation. ([#542][github-542])
 - The coupling between fields can now be specified when creating the global matrix with
   `create_sparsity_pattern` by passing a `Matrix{Bool}`. For example, in a problem with
   unknowns `(u, p)` and corresponding test functions `(v, q)`, if there is no coupling
   between `p` and `q` it is unnecessary to allocate entries in the global matrix
   corresponding to these DoFs. This can now be communicated to `create_sparsity_pattern` by
   passing the coupling matrix `[true true; true false]` in the keyword argument `coupling`.
   ([#544][github-544])
### Changed
 - Runtime and allocations for application of boundary conditions in `apply!` and
   `apply_zero!` have been improved. As a result, the `strategy` keyword argument is
   obsolete and thus ignored. ([#489][github-489])
 - The internal representation of `Dirichlet` boundary conditions and `AffineConstraint`s in
   the `ConstraintHandler` have been unified. As a result, conflicting constraints on DoFs
   are handled more consistently: the constraint added last to the `ConstraintHandler` now
   always override any previous constraints. Conflicting constraints could previously cause
   problems when a DoF where prescribed by both `Dirichlet` and `AffineConstraint`.
   ([#529][github-529])
 - Entries in local matrix/vector are now ignored in the assembly procedure. This allows,
   for example, using a dense local matrix `[a b; c d]` even if no entries exist in the
   global matrix for the `d` block, i.e. in `[A B; C D]` the `D` block is zero, and these
   global entries might not exist in the sparse matrix. (Such sparsity patterns can now be
   created by `create_sparsity_pattern`, see [#544][github-544].) ([#543][github-543])
### Fixed
 - Fix affine constraints with prescribed DoFs in the right-hand-side. In particular, DoFs
   that are prescribed by just an inhomogeneity are now handled correctly, and nested affine
   constraints now give an error instead of silently giving the wrong result.
   ([#530][github-530], [#535][github-535])
 - Fixed internal inconsistency in edge ordering for 2nd order RefTetrahedron and RefCube.
   ([#520][github-520], [#523][github-523])
### Other improvements
 - Performance improvements:
    - Reduced time and memory allocations in DoF distribution for `MixedDofHandler`.
      ([#533][github-533])
    - Reduced time and memory allocations reductions in `getcoordinates!`.
      ([#536][github-536])
    - Reduced time and memory allocations in affine constraint condensation.
      ([#537][github-537], [#541][github-541], [#550][github-550])
 - Documentation improvements:
    - Use `:static` scheduling for threaded `for`-loop ([#534][github-534])
    - Remove use of `@inbounds` ([#547][github-547])
 - Unification of `create_sparsity_pattern` methods to remove code duplication between
   `DofHandler` and `MixedDofHandler`. ([#538][github-538], [#540][github-540])

## [0.3.9] - 2022-10-19
### Added
 - New higher order function interpolations for triangles (`Lagrange{2,RefTetrahedron,3}`,
   `Lagrange{2,RefTetrahedron,4}`, and `Lagrange{2,RefTetrahedron,5}`). ([#482][github-482],
   [#512][github-512])
 - New Gaussian quadrature formula for triangles up to order 15. ([#514][github-514])
 - Add debug mode for working with Ferrite internals. ([#524][github-524])
### Changed
 - The default components to constrain in `Dirichlet` and `PeriodicDirichlet` have changed
   from component 1 to all components of the field. For scalar problems this has no effect.
   ([#506][github-506], [#509][github-509])

## [0.3.8] - 2022-10-05
### Added
 - Ferrite.jl now has a logo! ([#464][github-464])
 - New keyword argument `search_nneighbors::Int` in `PointEvalHandler` for specifying how
   many neighboring elements to consider in the kNN search. The default is still 3 (usually
   sufficient). ([#466][github-466])
 - The IJV-assembler now support assembling non-square matrices. ([#471][github-471])
 - Periodic boundary conditions have been reworked and generalized. It now supports
   arbitrary relations between the mirror and image boundaries (e.g. not only translations
   in x/y/z direction). ([#478][github-478], [#481][github-481], [#496][github-496],
   [#501][github-501])
### Fixed
 - Fix `PointEvalHandler` when the first point is missing. ([#466][github-466])
 - Fix the ordering of nodes on the face for `(Quadratic)Tetrahedron` cells.
   ([#475][github-475])
### Other improvements
 - Many improvements to the documentation. ([#467][github-467], [#473][github-473],
   [#487][github-487], [#494][github-494], [#500][github-500])
 - Improved error messages in `reinit!` when number of geometric base functions and number
   of element coordinates mismatch. ([#469][github-469])
 - Remove some unnecessary function parametrizations. ([#503][github-503])
 - Remove some unnecessary allocations in grid coloring. ([#505][github-505])
 - More efficient way of creating the sparsity pattern when using `AffineConstraints` and/or
   `PeriodicDirichlet`. ([#436][github-436])

## [0.3.7] - 2022-07-05
### Fixed
- Fix tests for newer version of WriteVTK (no functional change). ([#462][github-462])
### Other improvements
 - Various improvements to the heat equation example and the hyperelasticity example in the
   documentation. ([#460][github-460], [#461][github-461])

## [0.3.6] - 2022-06-30
### Fixed
- Fix a bug with `L2Projection` of mixed grid. ([#456][github-456])
### Other improvements
 - Expanded manual section of Dirichlet BCs. ([#458][github-458])

## [0.3.5] - 2022-05-30
### Added
- Functionality for querying information about the grid topology (e.g. neighboring cells,
  boundaries, ...). ([#363][github-363])
### Fixed
- Fix application of boundary conditions when combining RHSData and affine constraints.
  ([#431][github-431])

## [0.3.4] - 2022-02-25
### Added
- Affine (linear) constraints between degrees-of-freedom. ([#401][github-401])
- Periodic Dirichlet boundary conditions. ([#418][github-418])
- Evaluation of arbitrary quantities in FE space. ([#425][github-425])
### Changed
- Interpolation(s) and the quadrature rule are now stored as part of the `CellValues`
  structs (`cv.func_interp`, `cv.geo_interp`, and `cv.qr`). ([#428][github-428])

## [0.3.3] - 2022-02-04
### Changed
- Verify user input in various functions to eliminate possible out-of-bounds accesses.
  ([#407][github-407], [#411][github-411])

## [0.3.2] - 2022-01-18
### Added
- Support for new interpolation types: `DiscontinuousLagrange`, `BubbleEnrichedLagrange`,
  and `CrouzeixRaviart`. ([#352][github-352], [#392][github-392])
### Changed
- Julia version 1.0 is no longer supported for Ferrite versions >= 0.3.2. Use Julia version
  >= 1.6. ([#385][github-385])
- Quadrature data for L2 projection can now be given as a matrix of size "number of
  elements" x "number of quadrature points per element". ([#386][github-386])
- Projected values from L2 projection can now be exported directly to VTK.
  ([#390][github-390])
- Grid coloring can now act on a subset of cells. ([#402][github-402])
- Various functions related to cell values now use traits to make it easier to extend and
  reuse functionality in external code. ([#404][github-404])
### Fixed
- Exporting tensors to VTK now use correct names for the components. ([#406][github-406])
