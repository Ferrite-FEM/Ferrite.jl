# ## Introduction
#
# The heat equation is the "Hello, world!" equation of finite elements.
# Here we solve the equation on a unit square, with a uniform internal source.
# The strong form of the (linear) heat equation is given by
#
# ```math
#  -\nabla \cdot (k \nabla u) = f  \quad \textbf{x} \in \Omega,
# ```
#
# where $u$ is the unknown temperature field, $k$ the heat conductivity,
# $f$ the heat source and $\Omega$ the domain. For simplicity we set $f = 1$
# and $k = 1$. We will consider homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions such that
# ```math
# u(\textbf{x}) = 0 \quad \textbf{x} \in \partial \Omega,
# ```
# where $\partial \Omega$ denotes the boundary of $\Omega$.
# The resulting weak form is given given as follows: Find ``u \in \mathbb{U}`` such that
# ```math
# \int_{\Omega} \nabla \delta u \cdot \nabla u \ d\Omega = \int_{\Omega} \delta u \ d\Omega \quad \forall \delta u \in \mathbb{T},
# ```
# where $\delta u$ is a test function, and where $\mathbb{U}$ and $\mathbb{T}$ are suitable
# trial and test function sets, respectively.

# ## Commented Program
#
# Now we solve the problem in Ferrite. What follows is a program spliced with comments.
#md # The full program, without comments, can be found in the next [section](@ref heat_equation-plain-program).
#
# First we load Ferrite, and some other packages we need
using Ferrite, SparseArrays
# We start by generating a simple grid with 20x20 quadrilateral elements
# using `generate_grid`. The generator defaults to the unit square,
# so we don't need to specify the corners of the domain.
grid = generate_grid(Quadrilateral, (20, 20));

# ### Trial and test functions
# A `CellValues` facilitates the process of evaluating values and gradients of
# test and trial functions (among other things). Since the problem
# is a scalar problem we will use a `CellScalarValues` object. To define
# this we need to specify an interpolation space for the shape functions.
# We use Lagrange functions (both for interpolating the function and the geometry)
# based on the two-dimensional reference "cube". We also define a quadrature rule based on
# the same reference cube. We combine the interpolation and the quadrature rule
# to a `CellScalarValues` object.
dim = 2
ip = Lagrange{dim, RefCube, 1}()
qr = QuadratureRule{dim, RefCube}(2)
cellvalues = CellScalarValues(qr, ip);

# ### Degrees of freedom
# Next we need to define a `DofHandler`, which will take care of numbering
# and distribution of degrees of freedom for our approximated fields.
# We create the `DofHandler` and then add a single scalar field called `:u`.
# Lastly we `close!` the `DofHandler`, it is now that the dofs are distributed
# for all the elements.
dh = DofHandler(grid)
add!(dh, :u, 1)
close!(dh);

# Now that we have distributed all our dofs we can create our tangent matrix,
# using `create_sparsity_pattern`. This function returns a sparse matrix
# with the correct entries stored.
K = create_sparsity_pattern(dh)

# ### Boundary conditions
# In Ferrite constraints like Dirichlet boundary conditions
# are handled by a `ConstraintHandler`.
ch = ConstraintHandler(dh);

# Next we need to add constraints to `ch`. For this problem we define
# homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on the whole boundary, i.e.
# the `union` of all the face sets on the boundary.
∂Ω = union(
    getfaceset(grid, "left"),
    getfaceset(grid, "right"),
    getfaceset(grid, "top"),
    getfaceset(grid, "bottom"),
);

# Now we are set up to define our constraint. We specify which field
# the condition is for, and our combined face set `∂Ω`. The last
# argument is a function of the form $f(\textbf{x})$ or $f(\textbf{x}, t)$,
# where $\textbf{x}$ is the spatial coordinate and
# $t$ the current time, and returns the prescribed value. Since the boundary condition in
# this case do not depend on time we define our function as $f(\textbf{x}) = 0$, i.e.
# no matter what $\textbf{x}$ we return $0$. When we have
# specified our constraint we `add!` it to `ch`.
dbc = Dirichlet(:u, ∂Ω, (x, t) -> 0)
add!(ch, dbc);

# Finally we also need to `close!` our constraint handler. When we call `close!`
# the dofs corresponding to our constraints are calculated and stored
# in our `ch` object.
close!(ch)

# Note that if one or more of the constraints are time dependent we would use
# [`update!`](@ref) to recompute prescribed values in each new timestep.

# ### Assembling the linear system
#
# Now we have all the pieces needed to assemble the linear system, $K u = f$.
# Assembling of the global system is done by looping over all the elements in order to
# compute the element contributions ``K_e`` and ``f_e``, which are then assembled to the
# appropriate place in the global ``K`` and ``f``.
#
# #### Element assembly
# We define the function `assemble_element!` (see below) which computes the contribution for
# an element. The function takes pre-allocated `ke` and `fe` (they are allocated once and
# then reused for all elements) so we first need to make sure that they are all zeroes at
# the start of the function by using `fill!`. Then we loop over all the quadrature points,
# and for each quadrature point we loop over all the (local) shape functions. We need the
# value and gradient of the test function, `δu` and also the gradient of the trial function
# `u`. We get all of these from `cellvalues`.
#
# !!! note "Notation"
#     Comparing with the brief finite element introduction in [Introduction to FEM](@ref),
#     the variables `δu`, `∇δu` and `∇u` are actually $\phi_i(\textbf{x}_q)$, $\nabla
#     \phi_i(\textbf{x}_q)$ and $\nabla \phi_j(\textbf{x}_q)$, i.e. the evaluation of the
#     trial and test functions in the quadrature point ``\textbf{x}_q``. However, to
#     underline the strong parallel between the weak form and the implementation, this
#     example uses the symbols appearing in the weak form.

function assemble_element!(Ke::Matrix, fe::Vector, cellvalues::CellScalarValues)
    n_basefuncs = getnbasefunctions(cellvalues)
    ## Reset to 0
    fill!(Ke, 0)
    fill!(fe, 0)
    ## Loop over quadrature points
    for q_point in 1:getnquadpoints(cellvalues)
        ## Get the quadrature weight
        dΩ = getdetJdV(cellvalues, q_point)
        ## Loop over test shape functions
        for i in 1:n_basefuncs
            δu  = shape_value(cellvalues, q_point, i)
            ∇δu = shape_gradient(cellvalues, q_point, i)
            ## Add contribution to fe
            fe[i] += δu * dΩ
            ## Loop over trial shape functions
            for j in 1:n_basefuncs
                ∇u = shape_gradient(cellvalues, q_point, j)
                ## Add contribution to Ke
                Ke[i, j] += (∇δu ⋅ ∇u) * dΩ
            end
        end
    end
    return Ke, fe
end
#md nothing # hide

# #### Global assembly
# We define the function `assemble_global` to loop over the elements and do the global
# assembly. The function takes our `cellvalues`, the sparse matrix `K`, and our DofHandler
# as input arguments and returns the assembled global stiffness matrix, and the assembled
# global force vector. We start by allocating `Ke`, `fe`, and the global force vector `f`.
# We also create an assembler by using `start_assemble`. The assembler lets us assemble into
# `K` and `f` efficiently. We then start the loop over all the elements. In each loop
# iteration we reinitialize `cellvalues` (to update derivatives of shape functions etc.),
# compute the element contribution with `assemble_element!`, and then assemble into the
# global `K` and `f` with `assemble!`.
#
# !!! note "Notation"
#     Comparing again with [Introduction to FEM](@ref), `f` and `u` correspond to
#     $\underline{\hat{f}}$ and $\underline{\hat{u}}$, since they represent the discretized
#     versions. However, through the code we use `f` and `u` instead to reflect the strong
#     connection between the weak form and the Ferrite implementation.

function assemble_global(cellvalues::CellScalarValues, K::SparseMatrixCSC, dh::DofHandler)
    ## Allocate the element stiffness matrix and element force vector
    n_basefuncs = getnbasefunctions(cellvalues)
    Ke = zeros(n_basefuncs, n_basefuncs)
    fe = zeros(n_basefuncs)
    ## Allocate global force vector f
    f = zeros(ndofs(dh))
    ## Create an assembler
    assembler = start_assemble(K, f)
    ## Loop over all cels
    for cell in CellIterator(dh)
        ## Reinitialize cellvalues for this cell
        reinit!(cellvalues, cell)
        ## Compute element contribution
        assemble_element!(Ke, fe, cellvalues)
        ## Assemble Ke and fe into K and f
        assemble!(assembler, celldofs(cell), Ke, fe)
    end
    return K, f
end

# ### Solution of the system
# The last step is to solve the system. First we call `assemble_global`
# to obtain the global stiffness matrix `K` and force vector `f`.
K, f = assemble_global(cellvalues, K, dh);

# To account for the boundary conditions we use the `apply!` function.
# This modifies elements in `K` and `f` respectively, such that
# we can get the correct solution vector `u` by using `\`.
apply!(K, f, ch)
u = K \ f;

# ### Exporting to VTK
# To visualize the result we export the grid and our field `u`
# to a VTK-file, which can be viewed in e.g. [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/).
vtk_grid("heat_equation", dh) do vtk
    vtk_point_data(vtk, dh, u)
