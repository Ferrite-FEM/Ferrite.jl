# Boundary Conditions

Every PDE is accompanied with boundary conditions. There are different types of boundary
conditions, and they need to be handled in different ways. Below we discuss how to handle
the most common ones, Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, and how to do it `Ferrite`.

## Dirichlet Boundary Conditions

At a Dirichlet boundary the unknown field is prescribed to a given value. For the discrete
FE-solution this means that there are some degrees of freedom that are fixed. To handle
Dirichlet boundary conditions in Ferrite we use the [`ConstraintHandler`](@ref). A
constraint handler is created from a DoF handler:

```julia
ch = ConstraintHandler(dh)
```

We can now create Dirichlet constraints and add them to the constraint handler. To create a
Dirichlet constraint we need to specify a field name, a part of the boundary, and a function
for computing the prescribed value. Example:

```julia
dbc1 = Dirichlet(
    :u,                       # Name of the field
    getfaceset(grid, "left"), # Part of the boundary
    (x, t) -> 1.0 * t,        # Function mapping coordinate and time to a prescribed value
)
```

The field name is given as a symbol, just like when the field was added to the dof handler,
the part of the boundary where this constraint is active is given as a face set, and the
function computing the prescribed value should accept two input arguments (coordinate `x`
and time `t`) and return the prescribed value.

!!! note "Multiple sets"
    To apply a constraint on multiple face sets in the grid you can use `union` to join
    them, for example
    ```julia
    left_right = union(getfaceset(grid, "left"), getfaceset(grid, "right"))
    ```
    creates a new face set containing all faces in the `"left"` and "`right`" face sets,
    which can be passed to the `Dirichlet` constructor.

By default the constraint is added to the first component of the given field. To add the
constraint to multiple components a fourth argument with the components should be passed to
the constructor. Here is an example where a constraint is added to component 1 and 3 of a
vector field `:u`:

```julia
dbc2 = Dirichlet(
    :u,                       # Name of the field
    getfaceset(grid, "left"), # Part of the boundary
    (x, t) -> [0.0, 0.0],     # Function mapping coordinate and time to a prescribed value
    [1, 3],                   # Components
)
```

Note that the return value of the function must match with the components -- in the example
above we prescibe components 1 and 3 to 0 so we return a vector of length 2.

Adding the constraints to the constraint handler is done with [`add!`](@ref):

```julia
add!(ch, dbc1)
add!(ch, dbc2)
```

Finally, just like for the dof handler, we need to use [`close!`](@ref) to finalize the
constraint handler. Internally this will then compute the degrees-of-freedom that match the
constraints we added.

Since the constraints can in general depend on time we also need to need to call
[`update!`](@ref) with the current time in order to compute the prescribed values. The
same constraint handler can then be used for all time steps by calling `update!` with the
proper time, e.g.:

```julia
for t in 0.0:0.1:1.0
    update!(ch, t) # Compute prescribed values for this t
    # Solve for time t...
end
```

!!! note
    You *must* call `update!`, even if your constraints does not depend on time
    (as `dbc2` above), e.g. `update!(ch, 0.0)`.

!!! note "Examples"
    Most examples make use of Dirichlet boundary conditions, for example [Heat
    Equation](@ref).


## Neumann Boundary Conditions

At the Neumann part of the boundary we know something about the gradient of the solution.

As an example, the following code snippet can be included in the element routine,
to evaluate the boundary integral:

```julia
for face in 1:nfaces(cell)
    if (cellid(cell), face) ∈ getfaceset(grid, "Neumann Boundary")
        reinit!(facevalues, cell, face)
        for q_point in 1:getnquadpoints(facevalues)
            dΓ = getdetJdV(facevalues, q_point)
            for i in 1:getnbasefunctions(facevalues)
                δu = shape_value(facevalues, q_point, i)
                fe[i] += δu * b * dΓ
            end
        end
    end
end
```

We start by looping over all the faces of the cell, next we check if this particular face is
located on our faceset of interest called `"Neumann Boundary"`. If we have determined
that the current face is indeed on the boundary and in our faceset, then we
reinitialize `facevalues` for this face, using [`reinit!`](@ref). When `reinit!`ing
`facevalues` we also need to give the face number in addition to the cell.
Next we simply loop over the quadrature points of the face, and then loop over
all the test functions and assemble the contribution to the force vector.

!!! note "Examples"
    The following commented examples makes use of Neumann boundary conditions:

## Periodic boundary conditions

Periodic boundary conditions ensure that the solution is periodic. This is common
in multiscale modeling and computational homogenization when solving the finite element
problem on the subscale. The subscale problem is then solved on a Representative Volume
Element (RVE), or Statistical Volume Element (SVE), typically on a cubical domain, to
find the fluctuation field ``u^{\mu}`` with a known macroscopic field ``u^{\mathrm{M}}``
as input. Periodic boundary conditions is one choice for such a setup, and ensures that
the fluctuation is periodic.

A periodic Dirichlet boundary condition is described by

```math
\llbracket u \rrbracket = 0 \quad \mathrm{on} \quad \Gamma^{+},
```

where ``\llbracket \bullet \rrbracket := \bullet(x^{+}) - \bullet(x^{-})`` is the "jump
operator", and ``x^{+}`` and ``x^{-}`` coordinates on the image, ``\Gamma^{+}``, and
mirror, ``\Gamma^{-}``, part of the boundary. Thus, this condition ensure that the jump,
or difference, in the solution between the image and mirror boundary is the zero -- the
solution becomes periodic.

In `Ferrite` periodic Dirichlet boundary conditions can be added to the `ConstraintHandler`
by adding a `PeriodicDirichlet` as follows:

```julia
# Create a constraint handler from the dof handler
ch = ConstraintHandler(dofhandler)

# Construct the periodic constraint for field :u
pdbc = PeriodicDirichlet(:u, ["left" => "right", "bottom" => "top"])

# Add the constraint to the constraint handler
add!(ch, pdbc)

# If no more constraints should be added we can close
close!(ch)
```

This adds a constraint on the field `:u` that ensures that the solution on the mirror
boundary face sets (`"left"` and `"bottom"`) mirrors the solution on the image boundary
face sets (`"right"` and `"top"`).

The constraint is imposed in a strong sense, so note
that this requires (i) a periodic domain and (ii) a periodic mesh such that corresponding
element sides can be found on the image and mirror parts of the boundary, respectively.

#### Heterogeneous "periodic" constraint

Instead of solving the just the fluctuation field on the RVE it is possible to solve for
the full field. For example, in the multi-scale setup described above, where the solution
in the RVE is constructed as

```math
u = u^{\mathrm{M}} + u^{\mu},
```

it is possible to solve for ``u`` rather than just ``u^{\mu}``. In order to still ensure
a periodic fluctuation the constraint can instead be described by

```math
\llbracket u \rrbracket = \llbracket u^{\mathrm{M}} \rrbracket
\quad \mathrm{on} \quad \Gamma^{+}.
```

The `PeriodicDirichlet` constraint can be used for this too, although the constraint in this
case is not technically periodic as applied to ``u``, but ensures periodicity on the
fluctuation ``u^{\mu}``. This is done by passing a function to `PeriodicDirichlet`, similar
to `Dirichlet`, which, given the coordinate ``\boldsymbol{x}`` and time `t`, computes the
prescribed values of ``u^{\mathrm{M}}`` on the boundary.

As an example, consider the case where the macroscopic solution is constructed as follows
(first order homogenization):

```math
u^{\mathrm{M}} = \bar{u} + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \bar{u} \cdot [\boldsymbol{x} - \bar{\boldsymbol{x}}],
```

where ``\bar{u}`` is the homogenized field from the macroscale, and ``\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}``
the centre coordinate of the RVE. This corresponds to the following constraint in `Ferrite`:

```julia
# Construct the "periodic" constraint
pdbc = PeriodicDirichlet(
    :u,
    ["left" => "right", "bottom" => "top"],
    (x, t) -> ū + ∇ū ⋅ (x - x̄)
)
```
