# ## Introduction
#
# This tutorial gives a quick tutorial on how to assemble and solve time-dependent problems
# on embedded surfaces.
#
# For this showcase we use the well known Gray-Scott model, which is a well-known reaction-diffusion
# system to study pattern formation. The strong form is given by
#
# ```math
#  \begin{aligned}
#    \partial_t r_1 &= \nabla \cdot (D_1 \nabla r_1) - r_1*r_2^2 + F *(1 - r_1) \quad \textbf{x} \in \Omega, \\
#    \partial_t r_2 &= \nabla \cdot (D_2 \nabla r_2) + r_1*r_2^2 - r_2*(F + k ) \quad \textbf{x} \in \Omega,
#  \end{aligned}
# ```
#
# where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the reaction fields, $D_1$ and $D_2$ the diffusion tensors,
# $k$ is the conversion rate, $F$ is the feed rate and $\Omega$ the domain. Depending on the choice of
# parameters a different pattern can be observed. Please also note that the domain does not have a
# boundary. The corresponding weak form can be derived as usual.
#
# For simplicity we will solve the problem with the Lie-Troter-Godunov operator splitting technique with
# the classical reaction-diffusion split. In this method we split our problem in two problems, i.e. a heat
# problem and a pointwise reaction problem, and solve them alternatingly to advance in time.
#
# ## Solver details
#
# The main idea for the Lie-Trotter-Godunov scheme is simple. We can write down the reaction diffusion
# problem in an abstract way as
# ```math
#   \partial_t \mathbf{r} = \mathcal{D}\mathbf{r} + R(\mathbf{r}) \quad \textbf{x} \in \Omega
# ```
# where $\mathcal{D}$ is the diffusion operator and $R$ is the reaction operator. Notice that the right
# hand side is just the sum of two operators. Now with our operator splitting scheme we can advance a
# solution $\mathbf{r}(t_1)$ to $\mathbf{r}(t_2)$ by first solving a heat problem
# ```math
#   \partial_t \mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{\mathrm{A}}} = \mathcal{D}\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{A}} \quad \textbf{x} \in \Omega
# ```
# with $\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{A}}(t_1) = \mathbf{r}(t_1)$ on the time interval $t_1$ to $t_2$ and use
# the solution as the initial condition to solve the reaction problem
# ```math
#   \partial_t \mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{B}} = R(\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{B}}) \quad \textbf{x} \in \Omega
# ```
# with $\mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{B}}(t_1) = \mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{A}}(t_2)$.
# This way we obtain a solution approximation $\mathbf{r}(t_2) \approx \mathbf{r}^{\mathrm{B}}(t_2)$.
#
# !!! note
#     The operator splitting itself is an approximation, so even if we solve the subproblems analytically
#     we end up with having only a solution approximation. We also do not have a beginner friendly reference
#     for the theory behind operator splitting and can only refer to the original papers for each method.

# Now we solve the problem in Ferrite. What follows is a program spliced with comments.

# ### Initial condition setup
# Time-dependent problems always need an initial condition from which the time evolution starts.
# In this tutorial we set the concentration of reactant 1 to $1$ and the concentration of reactant
# 2 to $0$ for all nodal dof with associated coordinate $z \leq 0.9$ on the sphere. Since the
# simulation would be pretty boring with a steady-state initial condition, we introduce some
# heterogeneity by setting the dofs associated to top part of the sphere (i.e. dofs with $z > 0.9$
# to store the reactant concentrations of $0.5$ and $0.25$ for the reactants 1 and 2 respectively.

    ## interpolation with the same dimension as the physical space into which our
    ## elements are embedded into, which is in this example 3.

    ## A) We can add a scalar-valued interpolation for each reactant.
    ## B) We can add one vectorized interpolation whose dimension is the number of reactants
    ##    number of reactants.
    ## In this tutorial we opt for B, because the dofs are distributed per cell entity -- or
    ## to be specific for this tutorial, we use an isoparametric concept such that the nodes
    ## of our grid and the nodes of our solution approximation coincide. This way a reaction
    ## we can create simply reshape the solution vector u to a matrix where the inner index
    ## corresponds to the index of the reactant. Note that we will still use the scalar
    ## interpolation for the assembly procedure.

        ## the heat problem as initial guess. 2 is the number of reactants.

            rvₜ[2, i] += Δt*(  r₁*r₂^2 - r₂*(F + k ) )
        end
