#
# ![nsdiffeq](nsdiffeq.gif)
#
#
# In this example we focus on a simple but visually appealing problem from
# fluid dynamics, namely vortex shedding. This problem is also known as
# [von-Karman vortex streets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_vortex_street). Within this example, we show how to utilize [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl)
# in tandem with Ferrite to solve this space-time problem. To keep things simple we use a naive approach
# to discretize the system.
#
# ## Remarks on DifferentialEquations.jl
#
# !!! note "Required Version"
#     This example will only work with OrdinaryDiffEq@v6.80.1. or above
#
# Many "time step solvers" of [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl) assume that that the
# problem is provided in mass matrix form. The incompressible Navier-Stokes
# equations as stated above yield a DAE in this form after applying a spatial
# discretization technique - in our case FEM. The mass matrix form of ODEs and DAEs
# is given as:
# ```math
#   M(t) \mathrm{d}_t u = f(u,t)
# ```
# where $M$ is a possibly time-dependent and not necessarily invertible mass matrix,
# $u$ the vector of unknowns and $f$ the right-hand-side (RHS). For us $f$ can be interpreted as
# the spatial discretization of all linear and nonlinear operators depending on $u$ and $t$,
# but not on the time derivative of $u$.
#
# ## Some theory on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
#
# ### Problem description in strong form
#
# The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations can be stated as the system
# ```math
#  \begin{aligned}
#    \partial_t v &= \underbrace{\nu \Delta v}_{\text{viscosity}} - \underbrace{(v \cdot \nabla) v}_{\text{advection}} - \underbrace{\nabla p}_{\text{pressure}} \\
#               0 &= \underbrace{\nabla \cdot v}_{\text{incompressibility}}
#  \end{aligned}
# ```
# where $v$ is the unknown velocity field, $p$ the unknown pressure field,
# $\nu$ the dynamic viscosity and $\Delta$ the Laplacian. In the derivation we assumed
# a constant density of 1 for the fluid and negligible coupling between the velocity components.
#
# Our setup is derived from [Turek's DFG benchmark](http://www.mathematik.tu-dortmund.de/~featflow/en/benchmarks/cfdbenchmarking/flow/dfg_benchmark2_re100.html).
# We model a channel with size $0.41 \times 1.1$ and a hole of radius $0.05$ centered at $(0.2, 0.2)$.
# The left side has a parabolic inflow profile, which is ramped up over time, modeled as the time dependent
# Dirichlet condition
# ```math
#  v(x,y,t)
#  =
#  \begin{bmatrix}
#      4 v_{in}(t) y (0.41-y)/0.41^2 \\
#      0
#  \end{bmatrix}
# ```
# where $v_{in}(t) = \text{clamp}(t, 0.0, 1.5)$. With a dynamic viscosity of $\nu = 0.001$
# this is enough to induce turbulence behind the cylinder which leads to vortex shedding. The top and bottom of our
# channel have no-slip conditions, i.e. $v = [0,0]^{\textrm{T}}$, while the right boundary has the do-nothing boundary condition
# $\nu \partial_{\textrm{n}} v - p n = 0$ to model outflow. With these boundary conditions we can choose the zero solution as a
# feasible initial condition.
#
# ### Derivation of Semi-Discrete Weak Form
#
# By multiplying test functions $\varphi$ and $\psi$ from a suitable test function space on the strong form,
# followed by integrating over the domain and applying partial integration to the pressure and viscosity terms
# we can obtain the following weak form
# ```math
#  \begin{aligned}
#    \int_\Omega \partial_t v \cdot \varphi &= - \int_\Omega \nu \nabla v : \nabla \varphi - \int_\Omega (v \cdot \nabla) v \cdot \varphi + \int_\Omega p (\nabla \cdot \varphi) + \int_{\partial \Omega_{N}} \underbrace{(\nu \partial_n v - p n )}_{=0} \cdot \varphi \\
#                                  0 &= \int_\Omega (\nabla \cdot v) \psi
#  \end{aligned}
# ```
# for all possible test functions from the suitable space.
#
# Now we can discretize the problem as usual with the finite element method
# utilizing Taylor-Hood elements (Q2Q1) to yield a stable discretization in
# mass matrix form:
# ```math
#  \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
#      M_v & 0 \\
#       0  & 0
#  \end{bmatrix}}_{:=M}
#  \begin{bmatrix}
#      \mathrm{d}_t\hat{v} \\
#      \mathrm{d}_t\hat{p}
#  \end{bmatrix}
#  =
#  \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
#       A & B^{\textrm{T}} \\
#       B & 0
#  \end{bmatrix}}_{:=K}
#  \begin{bmatrix}
#      \hat{v} \\
#      \hat{p}
#  \end{bmatrix}
#  +
#  \begin{bmatrix}
#      N(\hat{v}, \hat{v}, \hat{\varphi}) \\
#      0
#  \end{bmatrix}
# ```
# Here $M$ is the singular block mass matrix, $K$ is the discretized Stokes operator and $N$ the nonlinear advection term, which
# is also called trilinear form. $\hat{v}$ and $\hat{p}$ represent the time-dependent vectors of nodal values of the discretizations
# of $v$ and $p$ respectively, while $\hat{\varphi}$ is the choice for the test function in the discretization. The hats are dropped
# in the implementation and only stated for clarity in this section.
#
#
# ## Commented implementation
#
# Now we solve the problem with Ferrite and [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl). What follows is a program spliced with comments.

# DAEs in mass matrix form.

# is passed to save some additional runtime. To apply the time-dependent Dirichlet BCs, we
# also need to hand over the constraint handler.
# The basic idea to apply the Dirichlet BCs consistently is that we copy the
# current solution `u`, apply the Dirichlet BCs on the copy, evaluate the
# discretized RHS of the Navier-Stokes equations with this vector.
# Furthermore we pass down the Jacobian assembly manually. For the Jacobian we eliminate all
# rows and columns associated with constrained dofs. Also note that we eliminate the mass
# matrix beforehand in a similar fashion. This decouples the time evolution of the constrained
# dofs from the true unknowns. The correct solution is enforced by utilizing step and
# stage limiters. The correct norms are computed by passing down a custom norm which simply
# ignores all constrained dofs.
