# Design Note: Implementing the IBWG2015 Node Iterator (LNodes)

## 1. The one core property, and the exact stop condition

**The property** that makes the recursion fast:

> *"If we applied Ancestor_id to each octant in A, we would get a monotonic
> sequence of integers, so if we search A with the key i and use Ancestor_id to
> test equality, the lowest matching index will give the first descendant of
> child(a)[i] in A."* — IBWG2015 C507

Because the leaf array `A` is **Morton-sorted** (total order, Alg 2.1, C504:
*"ancestors precede descendants"*), the descendants of any fixed octant occupy a
**contiguous block** of `A`, and `Ancestor_id(A[j], a.l+1)` is **nondecreasing in
`j`**. That single fact turns "partition the leaves under `a` into its `2^d`
children" from a scan into one combined binary search (`split_array`, Alg 3.3).
The engine never sorts and never hashes during descent — it only narrows
contiguous ranges of an already-sorted array.

**The exact stop condition** of `Iterate_interior(c, S, …)` (Alg 5.2, C515):

1. **Hard base case (line 1):** `if ∪S ∩ O_p = ∅ then return` — no carried array
   holds a locally-owned leaf. (Serial: every leaf is owned, so this only prunes
   empty branches.)
2. **Point finalized (`stop ← true`), fire callback *instead of* recursing, when:**
   - `dim(c) > 0` branch: some support array is the singleton `S[i] == {s}` with
     `s = supp(c)[i]` (line 7 — purely structural, `s` is a leaf); **or**
   - `dim(c) == 0` branch: **always** (line 16).

Termination is guaranteed by the **level cap**: each recursive call descends one
octree level (`child` level `a.l+1`), bounded by `b` (`_maxlevel=[30,19]`,
BWG.jl:13). The `2^d` child subarrays from `split_array` **partition** the parent
array, bottoming out at empty (return) or singleton (leaf-stop). Leaf equality is
**total-order identity** (level+coords, `isequal`), not pointer identity.

---

## 2. The true structure: point-centric, NOT volume/face/edge/corner

The paper's abstraction is a single recursion keyed on a **point `c`** —
*"iterating in the interior of a point"* (§5.2). It is **not** the p4est C-API
mental model of four separate Volume/Face/Edge/Corner callbacks, and it does
**not** recurse into "adjacent child-pairs."

`Iterate_interior(point c, arrays S)`:
- `S[i]` = sorted array of all leaves descending from `supp(c)[i]` (the `i`-th
  support octant of `c`). **`S` is the load-bearing recursion state.**
- One callback per point `c`, **dispatched internally by `dim(c)`**: `dim=d` →
  volume, `0<dim<d` → face/edge, `dim=0` → corner.
- Descent (`stop=false`): recurse over **`e ∈ part(c)`** — the *child partition of
  the point* `c` (eq 2.7) — building each `S_e[i]` from the `split_array`
  subarrays (`S_e[i] = H_j[k]` such that `h_j[k] = supp(e)[i]`, line 24). So
  `split_array` is called once per support octant and its subarrays are reused.
- The only table needed in descent is the **child-boundary-intersection set
  `B_∩^i`** (Fig 3 / eq 4.5; code `boundaryset`, BWG.jl:214/233), used at line 14.
  There is **no** `CHILD_FACE_PAIRS`/edge/corner adjacency table in the algorithm.

**Reconcile with a p4est_iterate-style API:** the per-dimension
Volume/Face/Edge/Corner callbacks are a **supported specialization** (§5.4) — a
face-only callback recurses into `e ∈ part(c)` only when `dim(e) ≥ d-1`. **Build
the point-keyed engine first; expose `dim(c)`-filtered callbacks as a thin layer
on top.** Do not invert this.

`Iterate` (Alg 5.3, the driver) is thin: for each tree form `S^t = O_p^t ∪ ghosts`,
then for every point `c` in the closure of every tree root, seed
`U[i] = S^{supp(c)[i].t}` and call `Iterate_interior`. Seeding from root closures
is what makes inter-tree boundary points get visited exactly once.

## 3. How hanging nodes are detected — NOT in the descent

**Correction to the obvious-but-wrong model:** there is **no** "one side is a
leaf, the other internal → hanging for free from a level mismatch" mechanism. The
iterator only ever visits **non-hanging** points:

> *"P_Ω is the set of all points shown: note that because some points in clos(o)
> are hanging, they are not included."* — IBWG2015 C512

The leaf-detection test (`S[i]=={s}`) is purely structural — no level test, no
hanging test inside `Iterate_interior`.

Hanging/master–slave coupling is a **downstream LNodes concept**, the
*remote-reference* test (eq 6.1, C517), evaluated inside the **LNodes node-callback**
(Alg 6.2 line 3), keyed on points `c`, using `leaf_supp_p(c)`:

> *"a leaf o remotely references a point c … if c ∉ leaf supp(c) and there exists e
> such that o ∈ leaf supp(e) and c ∈ bound(e)"* — IBWG2015 C517, **only when `dim(c) < d-1`**.

Concretely: at a non-conformal interface the **larger (coarse) leaf owns the
global node at `c`**; the smaller leaf's element node is interpolated from the
coarse basis and introduces **no new DOF**. This is the constrained→constrainer
map that `hangingnodes` (BWG.jl:803) builds in a separate pass today; in the LNodes
design it is produced in the **same single traversal** as the node ids — that
fusion is the point of the rewrite. The paper gives **no pseudocode** for the
LNodes callback (C519) — this is design work, not transcription.

## 5. Minimal build order (serial; current `creategrid` as oracle)

Single process collapses the distributed pieces: `is_relevant ≡ true`, owner ≡
`min`-leaf in `leaf_supp(c)` (the code's "lowest tree index `k`" rule,
BWG.jl:632/656/706), `Global_numbering ≡` contiguous counter, `Reconstruct_remote`
≡ skip.

1. **Verify the ordering prerequisite first** (everything depends on it): confirm
   each tree's `leaves` is Morton-sorted by Alg 2.1 and `ancestor_id` is monotone
   along it. See the `isless` concern, §6.
2. **Write `Iterate_interior` fresh against Alg 5.2.** Reuse only `split_array`,
   `ancestor_id`, `children`, `descendants`, `boundaryset`. **Do not** start from
   `search` (390). State = the `S` arrays; descend over `e ∈ part(c)`; leaf-stop =
   `S[i]=={supp(c)[i]}` / `dim(c)==0`.
3. **Write `Iterate` (Alg 5.3)** driver: per tree `S^t = leaves` (serial, no
   ghosts), seed from each tree-root closure. First with a trivial callback that
   collects `(c, leaf_supp(c))`; assert visited points + supports match what
   `creategrid` enumerates.
4. **Write `Lnodes_callback`** (design work, no paper pseudocode): per point `c`
   assign owner (`min` over `leaf_supp(c)`), emit one global id for non-remote
   points, fill connectivity. Validate node ids/connectivity against `creategrid`
   for linear elements — §7.3 (C523) proves Nodes and LNodes are essentially
   equivalent at `n=1`, so the resulting `NonConformingGrid` must be identical.
5. **Fold in hanging detection** via the remote-reference test (eq 6.1,
   `dim(c)<d-1`). Validate the constrained→constrainer map against `hangingnodes`.
6. **Delete the multi-pass cost centers** (Dict-of-tuples hashing BWG.jl:605-606,
   pairwise neighbor re-traversal Phase 2, `transform_pointBWG` on pre-dedup
   duplicates) once 4–5 match the oracle.

## 6. Code divergences that are latent bugs

1. **`search` (BWG.jl:399/403) — FIXED 2026-06-15.** The recurse guard was inverted
   (`isempty(idxset_match)` — recursing on the *empty* match set, vs Alg 3.1 line 6
   which recurses when non-empty) and the recursion dropped the `Match` callback.
   Both corrected; verified the descent reaches every leaf. `match` (420) is still a
   stub. This is the generic Search (Alg 3.1), a different algorithm from the
   LNodes iterator — write `Iterate_interior` fresh, don't extend `search`.
2. **`isless` (BWG.jl:113) — VERIFIED CORRECT (false alarm).**
   `morton(o, o.l, o.l)` shifts by `(b-l)*dim = 0`, so it returns the full,
   level-independent anchor interleave — the correct Alg 2.1 Z-order. Confirmed
   empirically: `issorted` + `searchsortedfirst` locate every leaf and reject
   refined parents in 2D/3D on balanced non-uniform forests, and `split_array`
   reconstructs the contiguous ordered leaves. The `searchsortedfirst` quick-fixes
   are safe. (Misleading TODO removed.)
3. **`transform_facet/edge/corner` orientation logic is empirical** (BWG.jl:1533
   "arithmetic switch: TODO understand this", :1567 "What is this condition
   exactly?"). The inside-vs-remote normal-axis sign differs from the paper /
   `_remote` variants; reproduced empirically. A soft spot if inter-tree node
   coordinates come out wrong.
4. **`boundaryset` docstrings mis-cite "Fig 4.1"** (BWG.jl:211/230) — it is
   **Figure 3**. Cosmetic, but it backs `B_∩^i`.
5. **`balanceforest!` uses an outer fixpoint** (BWG.jl:975) instead of the paper's
   single schedule/response round; 3D corner balancing incomplete (TODO :1033).
   2:1 balance is the load-bearing precondition for the iterator's `B_∩^i`
   selection — broken balance silently breaks descent assumptions.
